================================
	goal
================================
The goal of this software is to create graph of CI (center of interest) in different format, and in different language, for the algosphere alliance. (http://algosphere.org/)

================================
	minimal configuration
================================
You need :
- python 3.0 or highter
- graphviz 2.38 or highter (can certainly work with a lower version)

Please read the COPYING file for details.

================================
	how to use
================================
Algosphere-Graph is used by a command-line interface.
First you need to create a xml file, where you will add all the CI. (in fact you already have a ci.xml file, almost up to date with the algosphere alliance)
See "how to add CI" section for more information
Next you should use a few command-line:

>> xml_to_graphviz ci.xml ci.dot
Will create a ci.dot file (graphviz file), with the ci.xml file.

>> dot -Tsvg ci.dot > ci.svg
Will create a ci.svg file, with the ci.dot file, you can the see the graph if you open the ci.svg file.

================================
	how to add CI
================================
If you want to add a new CI, look at ci.xml, the way to do it is pretty straightforward.
  <CI>
	<name>Original name of the CI</name>
	<url>Official url of the CI</url>
	<children>
	//Original name of the children of the CI between "<child></child>" balises.
	</children>
  </CI>
When you add a new CI, you should do two complex task, add the children of this CI, and add the parents of this CI.

Add the children :
You should look through the list of CI, and whenever you find a CI that could be see as a specific way to go in the direction of the goal of the new CI, you should add it as a child of the new CI.
The child CI should be seen entirely as a specific way, and not partially, if part of a child CI does not have link with its parent, itâ€™s not a child.

Add the parents :
It exactly the symmetry of the add of children.
You should look through the list of CI, and if the new CI could be see as a specific way to go in the direction of the goal of this CI, you should add the new CI as a child of this CI.
